Through shared friends and participation in school theatre, Rachel and John first met in 2004 while attending San Dieguito Academy High School.  They drifted apart while John pursued his studies at San Diego State University and Rachel at Boston University, but would catch up over the occasional school breaks.
<br /><br />
During Rachel's final months at Boston University, John set a secret plan in motion.  That Christmas 2011, John suggested that the two catch up. Rachel agreed, expecting their usual casual bite to eat until John replied, “Great! I’ll pick you up at 11am and wear a dress.”  John surprised Rachel with seats to The Grinch at The Old Globe Theatre.  His sweet gestures continued with a Boston visit during her birthday in April 2012.  The pair’s texts just to say hi turned into hours-long phone calls.  Rachel moved back to San Diego in August 2012, and John left welcome home flowers at her door for when she arrived.  They made their relationship official that October, and consider their first “actual” date a Black Keys concert at the San Diego Sports Arena.
<br /><br />
After 3 years of dating, filled with trips to Napa and Russia, lazy weekends spent in pajamas, holidays enjoyed with family, John’s Friday nights on the football field with Rachel cheering from the bleachers, and the addition of one adorable kitty named Lily, John proposed on October 10, 2015.  Kneeling down in the sand on Marine Street Beach, John began, “Rachel Bethany Sabourin Stine, will you-” Rachel, “Yes!” John, “-marry-” Rachel, “Yes!” John, “-me?” Rachel, “Yes!”
<br /><br />
Rachel and John are overjoyed to celebrate the start<br/> of their marriage with closest friends and family in 2017.
